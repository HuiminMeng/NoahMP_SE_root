# NoahMP_SE_root
Here, I have modified the Noah-MP-Cop model (https://github.com/NCAR/noahmp) codes to develop a soil‑environment‑responsive dynamic root distribution scheme (SE_root) that accounts for soil moisture, temperature, aeration, bulk density, and soil texture.
The uploaded codes in this repository should be added/replaced at the corresponding source directories before compiling the Noah-MP v5.0 codes.
Noah-MP v5.0 codes downloading and compile methods are here:https://github.com/NCAR/hrldas/tree/master/tutorial
