## Noah-MP-Crop with SE_root

This project is based on the **Noah-MP-Crop model** (https://github.com/NCAR/noahmp). On the basis of the original codes, we have developed a **soil-environment-responsive dynamic root distribution scheme (SE_root)**. This scheme accounts for **soil moisture, temperature, aeration, bulk density, and soil texture**, enabling a more realistic representation of crop root distribution under varying soil environmental conditions.

The uploaded source code files should be replaced in the corresponding source directories before compiling Noah-MP v5.0.

For **downloading and compiling Noah-MP v5.0**, please refer to:

In addition, the following datasets used and produced in this study are provided:

- Simulation forcing data
- Site-observed data
- Model simulation results
